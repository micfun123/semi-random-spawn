This is a plugin that allows users to set Zones. Each zone is a area that a player can spawn in. These zones can be set in a config file, you can have as many zones as you want. Each player will get a random spawn point in a random preset zone.

Example Config
```yaml
WelcomeMessage: "Welcome %player% to the server! Prepare to teleport"
Zones:
  "Zone One":
    x1: 100
    z1: 100
    x2: 200
    z2: 200
  "Zone Two":
    x1: 300
    z1: 300
    x2: 400
    z2: 400
```
